Mesh deformer user instructions:
1.	Import package to project.
2.	Choose an object with a mesh filter component and collider
3.	Add MeshDeformer as a new component to chosen object
4.	(optional) Add objects to ignore deformation with to ignoreObjects list
5.	Test default settings (by having an object collide with chosen object)
6.	Tweak settings based on below criteria
7.	Repeat #5 until desired result


Mesh deformer tweak criteria:

Issue 1: Start time is long, deform time is good

	Cure 1: Increase ‘Max Verts Per Chunk’ value.
	Cure 2: Do not use chunking

Issue 2: Start time is good, deform time is long

	Cure 1: Enable 'Use Chunking'
	Cure 2: Reduce ‘Max Verts Per Chunk’ value.
	Cure 3: Disable 'Update Mesh Collider'
	Cure 4: Check mesh vertex count, may be too large to deform.

Issue 3: Start time is long, deform time is long

	Cure 1: Check mesh vertex count, may be too large to deform.

Issue 4: There is no deformation

	Cure 1: Reduce ‘Min Collision Velocity’.
	Cure 2: Increase ‘Max Collision Velocity’.
	Cure 4: Increase ‘Deformation Magnitude Scale’.

Issue 5: The deformation is too small

	Cure 1: Increase ‘Max Collision Velocity’.
	Cure 2: Increase ‘Deformation Magnitude Scale’.

Issue 6: The deformation is too large

	Cure 1: Reduce ‘Max Collision Velocity’ Y value.
	Cure 2: Reduce ‘Deformation Magnitude Scale’.
